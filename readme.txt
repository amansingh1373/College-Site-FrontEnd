this is a website made from react. This is a college website and has all the basic features that a college website might have. i have made an image slider in this project. I tried to use Bootstrap but i felt it is limiting my learning and creative skills hence i sticked to core CSS and about responsiveness i have made almost all things using flexbox so they are quite flexible they might not be good for a mobile user but for tablet and PC it is quite responsive and about the late submission as you might already know my team members didn't quite communicate with me and hence i have made this all project on my own without any external help and thus i have taken few extra days. since my exams are from 17/10/12 therefore I have done all this in quite hurry and not gone all out i deeply regret this but i hope you consider my situation.
